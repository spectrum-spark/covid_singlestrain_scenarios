# Impact of hybrid immunity on future COVID-19 waves: theoretical populations 

## 1. Run the "presimulation" files 

See https://bitbucket.org/thaople/covid-abm-presim/src/master/ which generates various parameter files and inputs such as demographics, contact matrices, and vaccination rollout.

Copy the contact matrices into this folder.

## 2. Main paper results

Run:

`make -f makefile.main`

### A. Simulations with BA1/2 first wave and BA1/2 second wave



### B. Simulations with BA1/2 first wave and BA4/5-like second wave


## 3. Supplementary materials

### A. Simulations with BA1/2 first wave and BA1/2 second wave with a worse vaccine

Run:

`make -f makefile.worsevaccine`
