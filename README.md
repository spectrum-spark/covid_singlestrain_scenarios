# Single-strain Modelling of COVID-19: exploration of vaccination and boosting scenarios

This repository contains the source code for an agent-based model of COVID-19 disease spread in a population. In particular, the code produces the model figures and results for a presentation given to IVIRAC on the 13th of February 2023.

Mathematical modelling assumptions can be found [here](https://spectrum-spark.github.io/covid-IBM/).

**Important note**: This repository does not contain the code for the clinical pathways model.

### Instructions

Before the main simulations can be run, some initial set up files need to be created first, in particular, defining the vaccination rollout. This is done in folder (presim_code)[https://github.com/spectrum-spark/covid_singlestrain_scenarios/tree/singlestrain-WHO/presim_code].

The main modelling simulation code is in the folder (main_ABM)[https://github.com/spectrum-spark/covid_singlestrain_scenarios/tree/singlestrain-WHO/main_ABM]. The folder contains specific instructions.

Note that there are different pieces of code that require Python, C++, R.
